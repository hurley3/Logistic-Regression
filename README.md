# Logistic Regression
This repository contains an implementation of logistic regression in Python. Logistic regression is a widely-used statistical method for predicting binary outcomes.

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following libraries:

* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To use the logistic regression model, you will need to have a dataset with a binary outcome variable and one or more predictor variables. The model can be trained and evaluated using the provided LogisticRegression class.
